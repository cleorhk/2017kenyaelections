# 2017kenyaelections
This is an API that contains data on the 2017 elections Kenya.  I have compiled and cleaned two CSV files fot this . The first CSV  contains the list of registered voters in Kenya. The second file gives details on the performance of two main presidential candidates, Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta on the first 2017 general elections.
